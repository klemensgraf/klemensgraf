## Welcome curious people ðŸ‘‹

I'm a work in progress as a software engineer and founder of [Fury Code](https://github.com/fury-code). Beginner at contributing to OSS and looking for opportunities.

Recently I started working on a GenAI application at work. You can read my [blog](https://furycode.org/blog/categories/artificial-intelligence) if you're curious and we can discuss it on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/furycode/comments/1g27a56/building_a_generative_ai_application_for_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
