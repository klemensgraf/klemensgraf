## 👋 Welcome, curious people

**DevOps Engineer · OSS enthusiast · Kubernetes-native**

I build scalable, automated infrastructure with Kubernetes at the core.  
Strong focus on modern CI/CD workflows using tools like Dagger.

I care deeply about:
- open source software
- platform engineering
- automation and reproducibility
- sharing knowledge through code

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you want to collaborate.
